Pressbooks is committed to ensuring that our software is accessible to users and readers. We understand accessibility 
and inclusive design to be holistic, proactive processes that must be included in our product specifications and 
development workflows. We also recognize that as a publishing tool, we have an opportunity to facilitate the production 
of accessible content. With this in mind, we have worked with accessibility and inclusive design experts at OCAD 
University’s [Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/), the University of Washington’s 
[Accessible Technology Services](https://www.washington.edu/doit/accessible-technology-services), the University of 
Texas at Arlington, and others to identify areas for improvement.

In 2019, we published our first [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)](https://pressbooks.com/accessibility/), 
which documented the Pressbooks authoring interface's compliance with WCAG 2.0 at the A and AA levels at that time. 
Recent audits have focused on ensuring that our publishing platform and reading interface are accessible to all users. 
In particular, we seek to conform with the WCAG 2.1 guidelines at level AA.

Because Pressbooks is built on WordPress, we benefit from WordPress’ 
[Accessibility Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/), which require that “All new or updated code 
released in WordPress must conform with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 at level AA.” We have been tracking 
the development of Gutenberg, WordPress’ block editing interface and 
[will not integrate Gutenberg with Pressbooks](/blog/2018/11/06/pressbooks-and-gutenberg/) until the accessibility 
issues raised [in its 2019 audit](https://wpcampus.org/2019/05/gutenberg-audit-results/) have been resolved.
