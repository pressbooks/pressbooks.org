At Pressbooks we use the Scrum framework for software development and work in two-week
sprints. To see what we're working on now, you can view our
[current sprint project on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/pressbooks/projects).

We also welcome ideas and suggestions for new product features in our GitHub
["Ideas" repository](https://github.com/pressbooks/ideas/). Our product owner regularly
reviews these suggestions and adds them to our prioritized product backlog.
