At Pressbooks we use the Scrum framework for software development and work in three-week
sprints. We welcome ideas and suggestions for new product features in our
GitHub ["Ideas" repository](https://github.com/pressbooks/ideas/). Our product owner regularly
reviews these suggestions and adds them to our prioritized product backlog.
