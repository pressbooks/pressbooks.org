These are our branches:

- **[master][1]** is our stable branch. You'll find it running on all our hosted networks and reflected in our [latest release][3]).
- **[dev][4]** is a general-purpose work-in-progress branch. It is merged with `master` when a new release is forthcoming.
- **[hotfix][5]** is for emergency patches. It exists solely to avoid conflicts with `dev`.
- Any other branches you find are for feature development prior to merging into `dev`. Use at your own risk.
- [Tags][6] represent releases, but if you are downloading a release for installation, you should download the package (e.g. `pressbooks-5.0.0.zip`) from [releases][7] as opposed to the source code.
