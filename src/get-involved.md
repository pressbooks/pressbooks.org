title: Get Involved with Pressbooks

Pressbooks is free and open source software, and our open source community is made up of people and organizations who use Pressbooks for many kinds of
publishing. Creating, improving, and maintaining open source software projects takes time, effort,and money. As a result, we ask our open source users, who depend on the long-term sustainability of the software, to contribute to the project by making financial contributions, helping to improve our code, translations, or documentation, or by providing support for other open source users.

## Financial Support

If you are an institution using Pressbooks and would like to help sustain Pressbooks financially at any level, please
consider [hosting Pressbooks with us](https://pressbooks.com/educational-institutions/) or
[contacting us](mailto:sales@pressbooks.com) to discuss how best to work together.

## Contribute via GitHub

You can always report bugs, open pull requests, and follow our development [on GitHub](https://github.com/pressbooks/). We also maintain an [ideas repository](https://github.com/pressbooks/ideas) where we welcome product suggestions and feature improvements
from any and all. Our product owner regularly reviews these suggestions and adds them to our product backlog.

## Monthly Product Update

We hold an open meeting at 2pm EST on the last Thursday of each month to discuss recently releases and upcoming work.
See our [running agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcvX0V-iDi6fJO_W8pHVOL_lec_9OTXujAfw6tFpZlQ/edit) for
details on how to join those updates, or watch recordings of past meetings on our
[YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM9fjHLyJsM&list=PLMFmJu3NJhet17A4FC_84OVDS8N18YyIo).

## Pressbooks Forum

[Our forum](https://pressbooks.community/) is a place for developers and Open Source users to discuss issues of interest
and ask others in the community for help. If you use Pressbooks, we invite you to help others in the community who may
be encountering issues.
