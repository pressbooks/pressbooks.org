Welcome to the home of the Pressbooks Open Source project.

Pressbooks is a book content management system that exports in multiple formats: ebooks,
webbooks, print-ready PDF, and various XML flavours. The system is built on top of
[WordPress Multisite](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#multisite), and
makes significant changes to the admin interface, web presentation layer and export
routines of a vanilla WordPress install.

Pressbooks is used by educational institutions, academic presses, small publishers, as
well as individual authors. There are three ways to use it:

- Let us host and maintain a Pressbooks network for you
  ([PressbooksEDU plans](https://pressbooks.com/get-started/) include priority setup, tech
  support and training, and save your IT/development team countless hours)
- [Host and maintain](https://docs.pressbooks.org/installation/) your own Pressbooks
  network (best for institutions with development staff devoted to maintaining your
  system)
- Use [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com/self-publishers/) (ideal for individuals or
  as a test bed for institutional use)

On this site we provide resources and links for the open source community.
