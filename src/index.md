Welcome to the home of the Pressbooks Open Source project.

Pressbooks is a book content management system that exports in multiple formats: ebooks, webbooks, print-ready PDF, and
various XML flavours. The system is built on top of
[WordPress Multisite](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#multisite), and makes significant changes to the
admin interface, web presentation layer and export routines of a vanilla WordPress install.

Pressbooks is used by educational institutions, academic presses, small publishers, as well as individual authors. There
are three ways to use it:

- Let us host and maintain a Pressbooks network for you
  ([PressbooksEDU plans](https://pressbooks.com/for-educational-institutions/) include managed hosting, security
  updates, tech support and training, and will save your IT/development team countless hours)
- [Host and maintain](/docs/installation/) your own Pressbooks network (you will likely need
  developers and sysadmins capable of maintaining your network and troubleshooting any technical issues)
- Use [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com/self-publishers/) (ideal for individual authors)

On this site we provide resources and links for the open source community.
