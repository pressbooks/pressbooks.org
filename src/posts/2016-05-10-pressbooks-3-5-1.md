Pressbooks 3.5.1 just went live on [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com/) and all of
our other production networks. Here's what's changed:

- Requires WordPress 4.5.2.
- Fixed: Resolved a formatting issue on the Export page (props to [@bdolor](https://github.com/bdolor)).
- Under the Hood: Added anchor, superscript and subscript buttons to core MCE routines
  (eliminating dependencies).
