Pressbooks 3.5.1 just went live on [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com/) and all of our other production networks. Here's what's changed:

- Requires WordPress 4.5.2.
- Fixed: Resolved a formatting issue on the Export page (props to @bdolor).
- Under the Hood: Added anchor, superscript and subscript buttons to core MCE routines (eliminating dependencies).
