Pressbooks 3.5.2 just went live on [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com/) and all of our other production networks. Here's what's changed:

- Feature: Login screen logo and color scheme can now be changed via filters (see [pressbooks@d09a104](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/commit/d09a104bfbbe3ad00a108004d0375ad1f7057ae0)).
- Enhancement: Google Fonts are now requested over https under all circumstances.
- Enhancement: Added some functionality to the Disable Comments plugin (props to @bdolor).
- Fix: Imports will no longer fail in certain environments (props to @monkecheese for the bug fix).
- Fix: Subsection titles are now properly sanitized for XHTML output.
