[Pressbooks 3.8.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/tag/v3.8.0) just went live on [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com/) and all of our other production networks. Here’s what changed:

- Feature: The redistribution option from [Pressbooks Textbook](https://github.com/BCcampus/pressbooks-textbook/), which allows a book administrator to share the latest export files of their book on the webbook cover page, has been migrated into Pressbooks and can be found under (Network) Settings -> Sharing and Privacy. Many thanks to [@bdolor](https://github.com/bdolor) for developing this feature (and fixing a display bug in our implementation of it).
- Feature: Luther and all child themes now support searching within webbooks.
- Feature: The Pressbooks.com promotion on book covers can now be hidden using the `PB_HIDE_COVER_PROMO` constant.
- Enhancement: [Hypothesis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hypothesis/) has been added to the supported plugins list, and the supported plugins list is now built more intelligently.
- Enhancement: The hard-coded default theme for new books has been replaced by the following logic: 1. Use `PB_BOOK_THEME` (if set); 2. Use `WP_DEFAULT_THEME` (if set); 3. Use Luther.
- Enhancement: Added the `pressbooks_register_theme_directory` action to support the registration of custom theme directores by third-party developers (props to [@bdolor](https://github.com/bdolor)).
- Enhancement: Added support for testing PrinceXML's built-in [PDF profile](http://www.princexml.com/doc/properties/prince-pdf-profile/) support by setting the `PB_PDF_PROFILE` constant to the desired profile.
- Enhancement: Refactored generic shortcodes to allow testing and test were written for them.
- Enhancement: Switched from internal fork to dev-master of gridonic/princexmlphp and switched to versioned copy of pressbooks/saxonhe.
- Enhancement: The `\Pressbooks\Modules\ThemeOptions` class now supports the registration of custom tags by third-party developers.
- Fix: Removed a leftover conditional check for the `accessibility_fontsize` option in webbooks (props to [@bdolor](https://github.com/bdolor) for the bug report).
- Fix: Internal links to parts now work in XHTML, PDF and EPUB exports.
- Fix: Fixed some faulty logic in the TOC collapse Javascript (props to [@bdolor](https://github.com/bdolor)).
- Fix: Fixed some incorrect color values in the mobile admin bar.
- Fix: Fixed a misplaced comment in the conditional check for IE 9 in Pressbooks Book (props to [@chrillep](https://github.com/chrillep)).
- Fix: Fixed a bug where protocol-relative images would not be exported properly in EPUB (props to [@bdolor](https://github.com/bdolor)).
