[Pressbooks 3.9.3](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/tag/v3.9.3) just went live on [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com) and all of our other production networks. Hereâ€™s what changed:

- **NOTE:** [Saxon-HE 9.7.0-10](https://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/Saxon-HE/) is no longer bundled with Pressbooks and must be installed separately for ODT export support (see [Installation](https://pressbooks.org/installation)).
- **Feature:** The copy on the publish page can now be replaced by adding a filter to the `pressbooks_publish_page` filter hook.
- **Feature:** If registration is enabled, a 'Register' button now appears on the front page of the Pressbooks Publisher theme.
- **Enhancement:** A URL sanitization routine has been added to the `\Pressbooks\Options` class.
- **Enhancement:** The methods of `\Pressbooks\Options` which list the options of various types (bool, string, float, etc.) are now optional, and the sanitize function now checks for each type before trying to sanitize it.
- **Enhancement:** The publish page has been refactored using the `\Pressbooks\Options` class.
- **Fix:** Unwanted validation warning emails will no longer be sent.
