[Pressbooks 3.9.4](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/tag/v3.9.4) just went live on [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com) and all of our other production networks. Hereâ€™s what changed:

- **Feature:** Pressbooks + Hypothesis: Version 0.4.8 of the [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is) WordPress plugin now supports custom post types, and Pressbooks 3.9.4 adds Hypothesis support to all of ours (parts, chapters, front and back matter).
- **Feature:** Having a problem with Pressbooks? We've added a diagnostics page which is accessible from the 'Diagnostics' link in the footer of every dashboard screen. If you need to report a bug, copy your system configuration info from your Diagnostics page to help us help you resolve the issue more efficiently.
- **Enhancement:** `check_epubcheck_install` can now be overridden using the `pb_epub_has_dependencies` hook for use cases where EPUB validation is not required (props to @monkecheese for the PR).
- **Enhancement:** Some adjustments were made to the PDF output stylesheets for running headers and footers.
- **Fix:** Fixed a visual glitch by hiding the TinyMCE table editor's inline toolbar.
