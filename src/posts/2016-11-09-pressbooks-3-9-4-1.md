[Pressbooks 3.9.4.1](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/tag/v3.9.4.1) just
went live on [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com) and all of our other production
networks. Hereâ€™s what changed:

- **Feature:** The copyright string in the Pressbooks Publisher theme footer can now be
  customized via the `pressbooks_publisher_content_info` filter.
- **Feature:** The text that is displayed when there are no books in a Pressbooks
  Publisher catalog can now be customized via the `pressbooks_publisher_empty_catalog`
  filter.
- **Fix:** Updated a component of the Diagnostics page to remove a deprecation notice
  (props to @thomasdumm for the report).
- **Fix:** Fixed a glitch in the Pressbooks colour scheme.
