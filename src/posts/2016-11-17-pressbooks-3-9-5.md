[Pressbooks 3.9.5](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/tag/v3.9.5) just went live on [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com) and all of our other production networks. Hereâ€™s what changed:

- **Enhancement:** The Pressbooks Publisher theme has been streamlined and refreshed.
- **Fix:** The version requirement for xmllint has been downgraded to 20706 to maintain RHEL 6 compatibility (props to @bdolor for the PR).
