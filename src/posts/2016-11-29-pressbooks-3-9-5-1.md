[Pressbooks 3.9.5.1](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/tag/v3.9.5.1) just
went live on [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com) and all of our other production
networks. Hereâ€™s what changed:\*

- **Enhancement:** Added
  [`pb_cover_image`](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/540/) filter to improve
  support for networks which host uploaded content on a third-party server (props to
  @monkecheese).
- **Fix:** Fixed a discrepancy in the line height of PrinceXML PDF exports of books using
  Cardo as the body font which resulted from an invalid descender value.
- **Fix:** Fixed an issue where the Network Sharing & Privacy page would not update the
  associated site option value.
- **Fix:** Fixed the vertical alignment of the Facebook share button in the webbook theme
  (props to @colomet).
