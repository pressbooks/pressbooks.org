[Pressbooks 3.9.8.2](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/tag/3.9.8.2) just went live on [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com) and all of our other production networks. Here’s what changed:

**NOTICE:** Pressbooks' PHP version requirement (>= 5.6) and WordPress version requirement (>= 4.7.3) can no longer be overridden. Before installing Pressbooks 3.9.8, please ensure that your system has been upgraded accordingly.

- **Fix:** Switched to an unmodified version of htmLawed to fix a regression in [vanilla/htmlawed](https://github.com/vanilla/htmlawed/) which was stripping paragraph tags from blockquotes (see [#723](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/issues/723)).
- **Fix:** Fixed an issue where users would be informed that their theme had been unlocked when saving Export options even thought it was already unlocked (see [#722](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/issues/722 "Fix theme lock notification")).
- **Fix:** Fixed an issue where wp-cli would give a permissions error because of the `\Pressbooks\ThemeLock::isLocked()` check (see [#721](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/issues/721)).
