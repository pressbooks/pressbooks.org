We just
released [Pressbooks 3.9.9](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/tag/3.9.9) on
GitHub and will be deploying it to [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com) and our other
production networks today. Here’s what changed:

**NOTICE:** Pressbooks now requires
[WordPress 4.7.5](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/05/wordpress-4-7-5/).

- **Feature:** A curated listed of recommended plugins is now displayed within the plugin
  installer (see
  [#729](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/729 'Add Better Plugin Recommendations functionality')).
- **Feature:** Search and Replace now supports regular expressions (props to
  [@stepmuel](https://github.com/stepmuel); see
  [#754](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/754)). This feature can be enabled
  by adding: `define( 'PB_ENABLE_REGEX_SEARCHREPLACE', true );` to `wp-config.php`.
- **Enhancement:** Updating a book theme will now trigger the regeneration of the webbook
  stylesheet (see [#727](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/issues/727) and
  [#762](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/762)).
- **Enhancement:** There is now a specific template part, `private.php`, for the page that
  is displayed when a book is private (props to [@stepmuel](https://github.com/stepmuel);
  see [#755](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/755)).
- **Enhancement:** "Part" is now properly localized in the PDF Table of Contents (see
  [#742](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/742)).
- **Enhancement:** Improved blank page rules in theme components.
- **Enhancement:** The Ebook theme options tab is now hidden when Ebook dependencies are
  missing (props to [@masaka222](https://github.com/masaka222); see
  [#745](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/745)).
- **Enhancement:** Dependency check results are now stored in site transients to reduce
  unnecessary function calls (see
  [#749](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/749),
  [#750](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/750)).
- **Enhancement:** Replaced variables with constants where appropriate (see
  [#751](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/751)).
- **Enhancement:** Replaced uses of `PATH_CURRENT_SITE` with `network_home_url()` (props
  to [@jeremyfelt](https://github.com/jeremyfelt); see
  [#734](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/734)).
- **Enhancement:** Current `$post` is now included with `wp_enqueue_media()` in
  `symbionts/custom-metadata` (props to [@jeremyfelt](https://github.com/jeremyfelt); see
  [#735](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/735)).
- **Fix:** Removed the sticky navigation bar that overlapped webbook content (props to
  [@pbstudent](https://github.com/pbstudent) for the bug report; see
  [#747](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/issues/747) and
  [#760](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/760)).
- **Fix:** Fixed an issue where running content strings would not be populated when a
  custom title page was used (see
  [#496](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/issues/496) and
  [#761](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/761)).
- **Fix:** Fixed an issue where the book title would not update properly (see
  [#542](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/issues/542) and
  [#746](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/746)).
- **Fix:** Fixed issues that arose when `pb_language` or `user_interface_lang` were not
  set (props to [@monkecheese](https://github.com/monkecheese) for initial bug report and
  testing; see [#738](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/738),
  [#739](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/739),
  [#740](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/740)).
- **Fix:** Fixed an issue where a database error would be thrown when installing on a
  utf8mb4 MySQL instance (props to [@jeremyfelt](https://github.com/jeremyfelt); see
  [#733](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/733)).
