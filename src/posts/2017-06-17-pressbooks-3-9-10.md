We
released [Pressbooks 3.9.10](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/tag/3.9.10) on
GitHub earlier this week and finished deploying it across our hosted networks today.
Here’s what changed:

**NOTICE:** Pressbooks now requires
[WordPress 4.7.5](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/05/wordpress-4-7-5/).

- **Feature:** Strikethrough text (the `<del>` tag) can now be used in front matter, part,
  chapter and back matter titles (see
  [#790](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/issues/790)).
