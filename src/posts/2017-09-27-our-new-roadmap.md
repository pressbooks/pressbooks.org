At the start of 2017, we established a
[development roadmap](https://pressbooks.org/roadmap/roadmap-2017/) for Pressbooks to
guide our work through the coming year. This past week we had the opportunity to review
and reflect on that roadmap during our retreat at Pressbooks HQ, and you can see our
[new roadmap here](https://pressbooks.org/roadmap/).

## 2017: Year of Core

I want to highlight a few of our accomplishments from the past nine months (you'll see
them crossed out on the old roadmap). In retrospect, our clear focus over the past nine
months was improving Pressbooks’ core technology. When
[Dac came back](https://pressbooks.org/blog/2017/05/11/dac-is-back/), having a second
developer let us expand upon my efforts in recent years to standardize our development
processes under the hood. We now use consistent
[coding standards](https://docs.pressbooks.org/coding-standards/) across all of our open
source projects, and we have adopted a
[standardized build process](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/mix) for admin and front end
assets. We have expanded our [code coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/pressbooks/pressbooks)
on the core Pressbooks plugin, and continue to do so with every release. These
improvements let us work more efficiently and give
[open source contributors](https://docs.pressbooks.org/contributors/) a clear framework
within which to contribute to the Pressbooks ecosystem.

Our most significant core enhancement is our new
[REST API](https://docs.pressbooks.org/api/), built on the
[WordPress Core REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) infrastructure. This
is the engine that powers our new
[cloning tool](https://pressbooks.com/blog/can-you-clone-a-pressbooks-book-you-can-now/),
and we will be making use of it in other areas over the next year. We’re also extremely
excited to see what the Pressbooks Open Source community does with an API for books. If
you are building something with it,
[let us know](https://discourse.pressbooks.org/c/apis).

## 2018: Year of the Author

The roadmap for our next year has a new focus: improving Pressbooks for authors. There are
a number of editing features that we included on our last roadmap that didn’t make the
cut, and our goal for the next year is to fill as many of these gaps in the Pressbooks
authoring toolset as we can. This includes:

- Broadening our support for math, interactive content, video and audio across all formats
  (with graceful fallbacks in static formats like PDF)
- Adding support for multiple contributors: authors, editors, translators and more
- Adding indexing and glossary support

And more! Take a look at our [new roadmap](https://pressbooks.org/roadmap/) to see our
comprehensive plans for improving Pressbooks’ authorship and editing tools, as well as all
other aspects of the project.

I’m very excited about our accomplishments since January 2017, and I’m looking forward to
building on them over the next year. Thanks to Apurva, Dac, Hugh, Liz, and Zoe for making
Pressbooks such a productive team!
