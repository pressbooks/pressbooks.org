This year will be a busy one for the Pressbooks team, so we’ve decided to share publicly
what we’re working towards in our two-week sprints. We hope this will give you a better
sense of what’s going behind the scenes, and help you plan your own development schedule!

Our sprint running January 22 – February 2 will focus on:

- Preparations for
  [Pressbooks 5](/blog/2018/01/17/pressbooks-5-developer-guide/)  
   _Our team will be thoroughly testing Pressbooks 5 to ensure its readiness for
  release._
- First cut of [chapter import](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/issues/1054)
  using the Pressbooks REST API  
  _We’ll be developing a feature that allows the import
  of individual chapters directly from a Pressbooks book. This development is
  supported by [eCampus Ontario](https://www.ecampusontario.ca/)._
- Product specification process for interactive content support  
  _The demand for
  interactive content, such as H5P, PHET simulations, iFrames, etc. has been steadily
  increasing, especially in the OER community. Our product team will be working on a
  product specification to best handle interactive content (audio and video) across
  all formats. This development is supported by
  [eCampus Ontario](https://www.ecampusontario.ca/)._
- New Open Textbook themes  
  _We’ll be testing and finalizing
  [Jacobs](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-jacobs) and
  [McLuhan](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book), two new Open Source themes
  ideal for Open Textbook creation, in preparation for their upcoming release. The
  development of these themes has been supported by
  [eCampus Ontario](https://www.ecampusontario.ca/)._
- [Book 2.0 (contains McLuhan)](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/projects/1)
  and [Aldine 1.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-aldine/projects/1)  
  _Continued testing and review of the new webbook (Book 2.0, which contains McLuhan)
  and new network homepage and catalog (Aldine 1.0) themes in preparation for
  release. The development of these themes has been supported by
  [Ryerson University](http://ryerson.ca)._
