A quick note from the dev team: we are working to improve our GitHub issue management.
With this in mind, we're closing stale issues which have not seen any activity in the last
60 days. This does not mean that they will not be revisited â€” many of them are on
[our roadmap](https://pressbooks.org/roadmap/), in fact! We just want to reflect what we
are actually working on.
