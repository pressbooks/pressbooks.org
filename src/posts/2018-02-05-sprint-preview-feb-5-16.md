_This year will be a busy one for the Pressbooks team, so we’ve decided to share publicly what we’re working towards in our two-week sprints. We hope this will give you a better sense of what’s going behind the scenes, and help you plan your own development schedule!_

Our sprint running February 5 – 16 will focus on:

- - Release testing of [Pressbooks 5](https://pressbooks.org/blog/2018/01/17/pressbooks-5-developer-guide/), [Aldine 1.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-aldine/projects/1) & [Book 2.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/projects/1) (including McLuhan) _Our team will be working through the final testing before release, slated for Feb 14th (pending anything unexpected)._
    - First pass implementation of [interactive content support](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/issues/1071) _Building off a product specification finalized in the previous sprint, we'll be working on the first iteration of interactive content support across all formats. This development is supported by [eCampus Ontario](https://www.ecampusontario.ca/)._
    - Jacobs 1.0 _We’ll be letting our new team member Daniel loose on finalizing [Jacobs](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-jacobs), one of two new Open Source themes ideal for Open Textbook creation (supported by [eCampus Ontario](https://www.ecampusontario.ca/)). Daniel has joined the Pressbooks team for three months to help us transition our themes to the new structure._
