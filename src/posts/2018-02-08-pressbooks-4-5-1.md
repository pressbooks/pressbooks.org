We tagged Pressbooks 4.5.1 on GitHub on January 25th -- apologies for the late release notes! This is a minor maintenance release in preparation for Pressbooks 5, and provides some forward-compatibility for those who will not be ready to upgrade to Pressbooks 5 right away.

Pressbooks 4.5.1 requires [WordPress 4.9.2](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/01/wordpress-4-9-2-security-and-maintenance-release/).
