_This year will be a busy one for the Pressbooks team, so we’ve decided to share publicly
what we’re working towards in our two-week sprints. We hope this will give you a better
sense of what’s going behind the scenes, and help you plan your own development schedule!_

Our sprint running February 19 – March 2 will focus on:

- - **Interactive content styling** *We have completed our first pass implementation of
    [interactive content support](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/issues/1071),
    and will be finalizing the styling of the messages injected in place of unsupported
    content in exports. This work is slated for release in 5.1 and* *is supported by
    [eCampus Ontario](https://www.ecampusontario.ca/).*
    - **Plugin Compatibility Checker** _This feature will identify plugins that are
      (in)compatible with available updates based on their plugin headers. A warning will
      inform Pressbooks administrators about extensions that haven’t been updated for
      compatibility with new releases._
    - **Theme Development** _We will also be continuing our theme development work, using
      the theme conversion process to identify improvements and potential new SCSS
      components in [Buckram](https://github.com/pressbooks/buckram)._
    - **[Pressbooks 5](https://pressbooks.org/blog/2018/01/17/pressbooks-5-developer-guide/),
      [Aldine 1.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-aldine/projects/1) &
      [Book 2.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/projects/1) (including
      McLuhan) release** _We plan to release the above early in the second week of this
      sprint, and to deploy to our hosted networks soon after._
