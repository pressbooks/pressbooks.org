With our
[sprint previews](/blog/2018/03/15/sprint-preview-march-19-30/),
[idea board](https://github.com/pressbooks/ideas), and various other initiatives, we're
increasing our efforts to foster and engage the Pressbooks Open Source community [1. And
if you or anyone you know wants to join our monthly Slack calls, it's now a
[whole lot easier](https://pressbooks-slack.now.sh).]. As part of this process, we have
decided to set up an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/pressbooks) account for
the Pressbooks Open Source project so that our Open Source users can, if they wish to,
contribute financially to the ongoing development of Pressbooks. While we are very proud
of our [PressbooksEDU](https://pressbooks.education) enterprise hosting service (and it
remains the best way to provide stable, ongoing financial support to the project), we
recognize that this isn't the right option for many users, and that those who still rely
on Pressbooks may want a different way to contribute. If that's you, please consider
[backing us on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/pressbooks), with either a
one-time donation or a small monthly contribution. Either way, even if you're not in a
position to contribute, we're glad to have you in our Open Source community!
