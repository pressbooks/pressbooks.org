Here's what we will be focusing on for our first sprint of Q2:

- [Buckram][buckram] development: We are working to finalize a stable release of Buckram,
  our book theme component library, which will include improvements to image layout, ordered
  lists, running content, and textboxes.
- [Pressbooks 5.x][pressbooks] and
  [McLuhan][mcluhan] bug fixes: We will be working on more improvements to McLuhan related
  to author name display and the web table of contents.
- Expandable content: We will be
  implementing a new interactive content feature — content blocks which are progressively
  enhanced to be expandable and collapsible in the webbook.

(Note: We've decided to push the development of the [new version tracking
feature][mcluhan-diff] that was planned for our past sprint to a subsequent sprint.)
