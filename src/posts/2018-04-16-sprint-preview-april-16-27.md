Here's what we're working on this sprint:

\- Further [Buckram][buckram] development, approaching 1.0! - Implementation of [a
feature][version-tracker] to compare a cloned chapter with its source, as described
previously. - Integration testing of [WP QuickLaTeX][quicklatex].

And other bug fixes and improvements as we find them!
