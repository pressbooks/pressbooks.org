We're pleased to share Pressbooks' new [policy on accessibility](https://pressbooks.org/accessibility):

\> Pressbooks is committed to ensuring that our software is accessible to users and readers. We understand accessibility and inclusive design to be holistic, proactive processes that must be built into our product specification and development workflow. We also recognize that as a publishing tool, we have an opportunity to facilitate the production of accessible content. With this in mind, we are working with accessibility and inclusive design experts at OCAD Universityâ€™s [Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca) and others to identify areas for improvement.

For full details, you can [consult the policy](https://pressbooks.org/accessibility).

As noted in this morning's sprint preview, we are tackling [a number of accessibility issues](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aa11y+milestone%3A2.3.0) in our current sprint thanks to clear, actionable feedback from Jonathan Hung and the team at the Inclusive Design Research centre. We're thrilled to be collaborating with the IDRC to make our project more inclusive to all users, and we're grateful for their insight as we develop our internal expertise on these vital issues.
