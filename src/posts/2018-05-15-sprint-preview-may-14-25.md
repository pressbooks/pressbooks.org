Here's what we're working on this sprint:

\- LTI provider plugin: This week, we'll be working on the Thin Common Cartridge component of our [Pressbooks LTI Provider](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-lti-provider) plugin, which will enable Pressbooks users to export a Thin Common Cartridge file directly from the standard Pressbooks export interface. We are grateful to all the members of the Open Source community who have helped us along this process for their valuable input! :) - [Pressbooks](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/projects/19), [McLuhan](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/projects/6), [Aldine](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-aldine/projects/6): We're getting close to finishing the Pressbooks 5.3.0 update, as well as updates to McLuhan and Aldine; if all goes well, we'll be aiming to release them on Wednesday, May 16th. - [Buckram](https://github.com/pressbooks/buckram/projects/1): We'll be fine-tuning our Buckram themes for Buckram 1.0 release. - On the front end, we'll be starting some spec work to improve usability on Aldine and webbook homepages.
