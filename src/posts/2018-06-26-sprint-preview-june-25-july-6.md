This sprint, we'll be working on:

- Seeking feedback on our
  [LTI/Thin CC plugin](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-lti-provider) from our Open
  Source community and tweaking it as needed.
- Releasing
  [Pressbooks 5.4.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/milestone/41) (which now
  includes our [DocRaptor](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/1240) export
  module).
- Releasing
  [McLuhan 2.4.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/milestone/13) (which
  includes [Buckram](https://github.com/pressbooks/buckram/projects/1) 1.0).
- Releasing
  [Aldine 1.4.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-aldine/milestone/11) (which
  includes support for WordPress 4.9.6's Privacy tools).
- Increasing Pressbooks' minimum
  WordPress requirements to
  [Wordpress 4.9.6](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-4-9-6-privacy-and-maintenance-release/).
- Testing the [Tablepress](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/tablepress/) plugin in all
  export formats.
- Merging our
  [Cover Generator](https://guide.pressbooks.com/chapter/how-to-design-your-book-cover/)
  tool into Pressbooks core in preparation for a future release.

Also, we'll be off both Mondays this sprint, as it will be Qu√©bec and Canada's national
holidays, so the Open Source call will happen on Tuesday, July 3.
