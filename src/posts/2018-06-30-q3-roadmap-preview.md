Q2 is drawing to a close, and we managed to get a couple of big-ticket items out the door:

\* [Pressbooks CAS SSO Plugin](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-cas-sso) \*
[Pressbooks LTI Provider Plugin](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-lti-provider)

We didn't manage to finish as many roadmap items as we expected, but here's what we
crossed out: \* ✔ Improve textbox and table styling across all formats \* ✔ Finalize new
theme structure and begin migrating themes \* ✔ Add support for Common Cartridge import
and export

We'll be going forward with a simplified list for Q3, with only a couple of big items. We
want to focus Q3 on general housekeeping tasks such as UX improvements and backend
optimisations:

\## Big projects

\* Provide basic support for Shibboleth SSO \* Add new shortcodes to facilitate
authoring \* Begin researching analytics solutions

\## Housekeeping items

\* UX improvements to the webbook Table of Contents \* UX improvements to the Export
page \* Other backend and frontend UX improvements \* Accessibility improvements \*
Ongoing theme conversions

If you’re planning on working on any of these items or would like to collaborate, please
let us know in the forums or tweet [@pressbooksdev](https://twitter.com/pressbooksdev)!
