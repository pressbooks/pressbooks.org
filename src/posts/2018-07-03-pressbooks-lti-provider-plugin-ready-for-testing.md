Good news for everyone using Pressbooks in the education sphere: Over the last couple of
months, we have been working on developing our own
[LTI Provider plugin](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-lti-provider/releases),
which is now almost release-ready!

The LTI Provider plugin will allow institutions to embed Pressbooks content in their
Learning Management Systems (LMSs) using the LTI standard.

In terms of features, the LTI Provider plugin will provide the same set of functionalities
as Lumen Learningâ€™s Candela plugin.

Basic features include:

\* Creation of manual LTI configuration \* Automatic configuration via LMS \* Common
Cartridge exports (versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) \* Deep Links

The plugin has been available for some time on our GitHub repository, and we have had
valuable input from the Pressbooks open source community.

We encourage you to give the
[latest version](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-lti-provider/releases) a test
and send us your feedback via GitHub!

Documentation for the Pressbooks LTI Provider plugin is available here:
