[Pressbooks 5.4.5](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/tag/5.4.5) is out, fixing a longstanding issue where paragraph separation for webbooks would change when switching themes. Thanks to [Steel Wagstaff](https://github.com/steelwagstaff) and [James Paradiso](https://github.com/paradisojr) for reporting it!
