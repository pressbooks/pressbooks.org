As many of you know, we maintain a forum for Open Source users of Pressbooks at https://discourse.pressbooks.org. After some internal discussion, we've decided to close down the #opensource channel on Pressbooks Slack and refocus our Open Source community efforts on the forum. We've decided on this change because we believe that keeping conversations among our Open Source users on the open web is the best way to serve the broadest possible community of Pressbooks users. Many of you are already members of our Discourse forum and are actively involved sharing tips & tricks, suggesting features and helping your fellow Open Source users. If you aren't yet a member, we encourage you to [sign up](https://discourse.pressbooks.org/signup)! Thanks and please don't hesitate to follow up with me by email — ned [at] pressbooks.com — if you have any questions.
