We're releasing [Pressbooks 5.5.3](https://docs.pressbooks.org/changelog/pressbooks/#5-5-3) and [McLuhan 2.5.2](https://docs.pressbooks.org/changelog/pressbooks-book/#2-5-2) today. In Pressbooks we've optimized two chunks of our codebase that were responsible for some performance issues, and in McLuhan we've patched some SCSS that was generating invalid CSS. Thanks to [Thomas Dumm](https://github.com/thomasdumm) for reporting this issue.
