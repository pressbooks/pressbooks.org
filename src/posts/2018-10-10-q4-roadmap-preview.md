In Q3, we added a couple new and exciting features to Pressbooks:

\* Image attributions (thanks to Brad and Alex at [BCcampus](https://bccampus.ca)) \* New
shortcodes to facilitate adding more complex content

We also released a new Open Source plugin,
[Pressbooks Shibboleth SSO](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-shibboleth-sso),
which provides bilateral Shibboleth SSO integration for Pressbooks networks. And we
converted a few more themes to use Buckram, our theme component library, which gives us
added flexibility to add new theme options for all themes.

In Q4 we're wrapping up a few loose ends from our Q3 goals:

\* UX improvements to the webbook Table of Contents \* UX improvements to the Export page

We're also working on:

\* UI and UX improvements to the Theme Options page \* Adding support for DOIs in Book
Info and metadata outputs \* Testing integration with Gutenberg, WordPress' new editing
interface \* Continuing to convert themes and improve Buckram

As always, we'd love to hear your ideas for Pressbooks, so feel free to share them in the
[Pressbooks Community Forum](https://discourse.pressbooks.org)!
