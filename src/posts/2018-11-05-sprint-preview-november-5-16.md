This sprint we are wrapping up the development and testing of
[Pressbooks 5.6.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/projects/31) and
[McLuhan 2.6.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/projects/12), which we
intend to release in the latter half of November. This includes some final polish on the
new glossary feature, adding support for HTML5 image markup using `<figure>` and
`<figcaption>`, and adding the ability to target print and digital PDF with different
stylesheets.
