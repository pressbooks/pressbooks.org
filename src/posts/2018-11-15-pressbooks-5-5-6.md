[Pressbooks 5.5.6](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/tag/5.5.6) is now
available. This release fixes an issue where very large posts with lengthy revision
histories could crash the editor due to an unoptimized revisions query. Thanks to
[Steve Swettenham](https://github.com/pbstudent) for reporting this bug!
