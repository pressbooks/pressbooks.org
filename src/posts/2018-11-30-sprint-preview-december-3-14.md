Our last full sprint of the year will be focused on bug fixes following our latest release and planning for the Pressbooks 5.7.0 and McLuhan 2.7.0 (plus Buckram 1.3.0) release cycles. We'll be compiling ideas for implementation in the [Pressbooks 5.7.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/projects/38), [McLuhan 2.7.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/projects/18), and [Buckram 1.3.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/projects/17) GitHub projects.
