We just finished our last releases of 2018, [Pressbooks 5.6.3](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/5.6.3) and [McLuhan 2.6.1](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/releases/2.6.1). We'll be deploying them to all hosted networks at the start of next week. These are minor bug fix releases which improve shortcodes, a focus style regression in McLuhan, and a bug with Hypothesis highlights which was introduced in McLuhan 2.6.0.

A note about [WordPress 5.0 "Bebo"](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/): we've tested Pressbooks with WordPress 5.0 in our development and staging environments, and we are confident that open source users can proceed to update their networks to WordPress 5.0 without any disruption. As we previously wrote, we've [disabled Gutenberg](https://pressbooks.org/blog/2018/11/06/pressbooks-and-gutenberg/) for the time being, so the editing experience will not be affected. We will be waiting to update our hosted networks until January.
