In December, the Pressbooks team spent some time planning our roadmap for Q1 2019. We've got some exciting projects planned for the next few months. Here's some of what we'll be working on:

\* Rebuilding the Export page with progress indicators during exports, improved management of export files, and full keyboard accessibility \* Adding progress indicators to Clone and Import pages \* Adding [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) support for contributors \* Improving support for books with editors or translators as primary contributors \* Adding support for cloning [H5P](https://h5p.org) content \* Adding metadata to webbooks to make it easier to cite them with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) \* Adding [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) metadata to webbooks \* Adding a central database table of book metadata to Pressbooks networks to improve the performance of our \`/books\` API endpoint and tools that use it \* Improving the functionality of the network catalog \* Improving usage statistics at the network level \* Adding the ability for network managers to set some default theme options at the network level \* Exploring direct importing of Google Docs \* Pursuing official certification for our LTI Provider plugin

These are our big projects; as always, we'll continue to refine and improve Pressbooks in smaller ways in each sprint. If you have any questions we're always happy to discuss! Our first Open Source call of the year will be on Monday, January 7th at 2pm Eastern. An agenda and Zoom link will be posted here and on our community forum by Monday morning.
