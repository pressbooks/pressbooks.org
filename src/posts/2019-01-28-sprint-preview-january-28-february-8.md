This sprint we're continuing work towards our next release, [Pressbooks 5.7](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/projects/38). We'll be focusing on the following projects:

\- Refining the newly-rebuilt [export page](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/1553) and integrating real-time progress indicators - Solidifying support for cloning [H5P activities](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/issues/1529) - [Improvements](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/pull/1559) to our glossary tool, bringing support for rich text and better tooltips - Releasing version 2.0 of our Atwood theme, and preparing versions 2.0 of Graham and Bradbury and version 3.0 of Austen for release in a future sprint

Also, we're changing our sprint structure a little bit. We'll be continuing to work in two-week sprints, but we're going to include a one-week [Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban) in between sprints for smaller bug fixes and improvements, product spec preparation, and planning. We will continue to share sprint previews but these will now come every three weeks instead of every two weeks (with the next sprint preview coming Monday, February 18th).
