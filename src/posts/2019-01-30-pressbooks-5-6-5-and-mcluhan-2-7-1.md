We've just released [Pressbooks 5.6.5](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/tag/5.6.5) and [McLuhan 2.7.1](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/releases/tag/2.7.1). Pressbooks 5.6.5 adds support for EPUBCheck 4.1 (props [Brad](https://github.com/bdolor)) and fixes a bug related to editing parts (props [Josie](https://github.com/josieg) for the bug report), as well as further optimizing SCSS compilation performance. McLuhan 2.7.1 includes Buckram 1.3.1 and fixes a bug which prevented direct linking to anchors within collapsed sections (props [Josie](https://github.com/josieg) for the bug report).
