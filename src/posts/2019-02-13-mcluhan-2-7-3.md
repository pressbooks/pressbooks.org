Today we're releasing
[McLuhan 2.7.3](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/releases/tag/2.7.3) which
also includes changes from
[McLuhan 2.7.2](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/releases/tag/2.7.2). This
combined release fixes an alignment issue for interactive content fallback images in
[Buckram](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/blob/baafe90/packages/buckram/CHANGELOG.md#133),
and fixes an issue where pagination links would be collapsed into collapsible sections.
