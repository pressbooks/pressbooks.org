This sprint, we're focusing on wrapping up the releases of [Pressbooks 5.7.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/projects/38) and [McLuhan 2.8.0](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book/projects/20). These releases will include a number of major improvements to the user experience and accessibility of the import, export, and clone tools, improvements to the glossary tool and tooltips, improved webbook metadata (including Zotero citation support), H5P activity cloning with supported versions of H5P (1.12, not yet released), and many other tweaks and bug fixes. We won't be releasing these updates this sprint, but instead will be tagging release candidates for feedback from clients and open source users prior to production release in early March.
