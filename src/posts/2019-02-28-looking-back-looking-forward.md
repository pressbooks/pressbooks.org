After nearly eight years as part of the Pressbooks team—as a contractor from 2011–2015 and
as lead developer since 2015—I’ve decided to return to my
[freelance practice](https://bight.dev). It’s been thrilling to see Pressbooks grow into
what it is today, and to have been a part of that journey. I’m grateful to Hugh, Liz,
Steel, Dac, Daniel, Taylor, and Phil (and Apurva and Zoe) for being such wonderful
colleagues and I hope to stay involved with the Pressbooks project in the future!
