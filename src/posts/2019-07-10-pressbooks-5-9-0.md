Pressbooks 5.9.0 has been released. Keyword: _**MathJax!**_

More info:

- <https://pressbooks.com/2019/07/10/mathjax-now-available-on-pressbooksedu/>

Upgrading requires a replacement for wp.com/latex.php which uses MathJax in place of
WordPress' LaTeX image rendering service. If you are unable or unwilling to install and
host the [pb-mathjax](https://github.com/pressbooks/pb-mathjax) microservice, you may wish
to install and network activate the
[WP QuickLaTeX](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/quicklatex/) plugin.
