Hi all,

The monthly "open source calls" we previously held on the first Monday of each month are
being replaced by a monthly "product update webinar." These product update meetings will
be held from 2-3pm ET on the last Thursday of each month; the first of them will be this
Thursday, March 26. Meetings will be held in [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/583078361). A
recurring event for these meetings has been published to
[Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=N3BqbXBsbTRhMW1pMmVlbDNnYWRmNDVvN2tfMjAyMDAzMjZUMTgwMDAwWiBzdGVlbEBwcmVzc2Jvb2tzLmNvbQ&tmsrc=steel%40pressbooks.com&scp=ALL).

Meetings will include a demonstration of recent improvements we've released and overview
of projects that we're currently working on. Weâ€™ll also leave conversation space for
attendees to share news and updates about local development projects of interest, and to
provide input on your Pressbooks-related product needs and desires.

The March 26 webinar will include an update on recent progress we've made on two
long-awaited projects: 1) a searchable, filterable directory of public books across all
known Pressbooks networks and 2) updates to our LTI provider plugin to make it compatible
with the new 1.3 specification and add support for grade passback to the Learning
Management System.

Hope to see you later this week!
