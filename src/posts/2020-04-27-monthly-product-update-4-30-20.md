We will be holding our monthly "product update webinar" from 2-3pm ET this Thursday, April 30. This webinar will include a demonstration of recent improvements we’ve released and progress we’ve made on LTI 1.3 (including grade passback!). We'll also include time for you to share news & updates about any Pressbooks-related development projects you’ve been working on. See a [more detailed agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcvX0V-iDi6fJO\_W8pHVOL\_lec\_9OTXujAfw6tFpZlQ/edit?usp=sharing) for details, including the meeting link.

Hope to see you later this week!
