We will be holding our monthly "product update webinar" from 2-3pm ET this Thursday,
May 28. This webinar will include a demonstration of recent improvements we’ve released
and progress we’ve made on two big development projects: LTI 1.3/Advtantage and a
directory of Pressbooks books published across many networks. We'll also include time for
you to share news & updates about any Pressbooks-related development projects you’ve been
working on. See a
[more detailed agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcvX0V-iDi6fJO_W8pHVOL_lec_9OTXujAfw6tFpZlQ/edit?usp=sharing)
for details, including the meeting link.

Hope to see you soon!
