We'll be holding our next product update webinar on Thursday, June 25 from 2-3pm ET. This webinar will include a demonstration of the new Pressbooks Directory we've been working on, as well as an overview of other recent improvements we’ve made (including [LTI 1.3 certification](https://site.imsglobal.org/certifications/pressbooks/pressbooks-lti-13)!). As always, the session will include time for you to share news & updates about any Pressbooks-related development projects you’ve been working on.

See a [more detailed agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcvX0V-iDi6fJO\_W8pHVOL\_lec\_9OTXujAfw6tFpZlQ/edit?usp=sharing) for details, including the meeting link. Hope to see some of you virtually this Thursday!
