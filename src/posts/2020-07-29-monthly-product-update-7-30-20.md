We'll be holding our next product update webinar on Thursday, July 30 from 2-3pm ET. This
webinar will include a demonstration of recent work we've undertaken on Pressbooks
Directory as well as general product updates. As always, the session will include time for
you to share news & updates about any Pressbooks-related development projects youâ€™ve been
working on.
