We’ll be holding our next product update webinar on Thursday, August 27 from 2-3pm ET.
This webinar will include general product updates and a demonstration of recent
improvements to Pressbooks Directory. As always, the webinar will also include time for
you to share news & updates about any Pressbooks-related development projects you’ve been
working on.
