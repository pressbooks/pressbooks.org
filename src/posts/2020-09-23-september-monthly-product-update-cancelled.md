We are cancelling the product update webinar for September. It's been a hectic month for
some of us with the start of a new school year, a couple of weeks of wildfire smoke, and
other challenges. We'll return to
[our normal schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcvX0V-iDi6fJO_W8pHVOL_lec_9OTXujAfw6tFpZlQ/edit)
in October by holding our next monthly product update at 2pm ET on Thursday, October 29th.
Looking forward to seeing many of you then!
