We’ll be holding our next product update webinar on Thursday, October 29 from 2-3pm ET.
This webinar will include general product updates and a pre-launch demonstration of our
long-awaited Pressbooks Directory. As always, the webinar will also include time for you
to share news & updates about any Pressbooks-related development projects you’ve been
working on.
