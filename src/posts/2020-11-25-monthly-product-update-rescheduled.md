There will be no monthly product update webinar this week (Thursday falls on the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States). Instead, we'll be hosting a Pressbooks Directory launch webinar next Thursday, December 3rd, from 2-3pm ET. In this webinar, we'll be unveiling and providing a tour of our newly released Pressbooks Directory. The webinar will feature a hands on demonstration of how it can be used to find books from across several PressbooksEDU networks for adoption and adaptation, and a discussion of how self-hosted and open source networks can request to have their networks included in the Directory. See [a more detailed agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcvX0V-iDi6fJO\_W8pHVOL\_lec\_9OTXujAfw6tFpZlQ/edit) for details, including the meeting link. Hope to see many of you there!
