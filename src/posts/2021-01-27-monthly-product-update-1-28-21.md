We’ll be holding our next product update webinar on Thursday, January 28, 2021 from 2-3pm ET. This webinar will include general product updates and a demonstration of new features/functionality available in the Pressbooks Directory. As always, the webinar will also include time for you to share news & updates about any Pressbooks-related development projects you’ve been working on.

See [a more detailed agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcvX0V-iDi6fJO\_W8pHVOL\_lec\_9OTXujAfw6tFpZlQ/edit) for details, including the meeting link. Hope to see some of you virtually this Thursday!
