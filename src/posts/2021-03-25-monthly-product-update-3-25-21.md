It's hard to believe it's already the last Thursday of the month, but it is, which means
that we’ll be holding our next product update webinar TODAY (Thursday, March 25) from
2-3pm ET.

This webinar will include general product updates and a demonstration of new features and
designs being planned for Pressbooks Directory. We will also include time for you to share
news & updates about any general interest Pressbooks-related projects you’ve been working
on.
