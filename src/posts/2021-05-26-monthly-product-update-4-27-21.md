Hi all it's that time again -- our monthly Pressbooks product update will be held tomorrow (Thursday, May 27) from 2-3pm ET.

The webinar will include a demonstration of new features and bug fixes we've released in the last month and a preview of the nearly completed Pressbooks Directory redesign. We will also include time for you to share news & updates about any general interest Pressbooks-related projects youâ€™ve been working on.

See this [more detailed agenda for the Zoom link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcvX0V-iDi6fJO_W8pHVOL_lec_9OTXujAfw6tFpZlQ/edit). Hope to see some of you there!
