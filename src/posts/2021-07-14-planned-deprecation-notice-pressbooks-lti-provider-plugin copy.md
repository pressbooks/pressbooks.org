IMS Global [recently announced](http://www.imsglobal.org/lti-security-announcement-and-deprecation-schedule) that they will no longer certify legacy versions of LTI after June 30, 2021. They also announced that all support for pre-LTI 1.3 versions will end on June 30, 2022.

Due to this specification being retired, we will be discontinuing active development of our [Pressbooks LTI Provider plugin](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-lti-provider) and archiving the repository. Like other plugins and themes that we have previously archived, this repository will remain publicly available in read-only mode, though we will be unable to provide support for users who wish to maintain or extend the project.

For our PressbooksEDU clients, we have developed and maintain an [IMS Global certified](https://site.imsglobal.org/certifications/pressbooks/pressbooks-lti-13) replacement plugin, which supports the LTI 1.3 specification as well as the Assignment and Grade Services extension. We call this product ['Pressbooks Results for LMS'](https://pressbooks.com/our-products/#:~:text=Pressbooks%20Results%20for%20LMS). It is currently available as an optional add-on for our SaaS clients. For more information, please [contact our sales team](https://pressbooks.com/contact-pressbooks/) directly.
