We’re cancelling the monthly Pressbooks product update webinar for November (US Thanksgiving) and December (holiday season), as the scheduled dates fell on days that we won’t be working. We will post written updates in [the Community Forum](https://pressbooks.community/c/pressbooks-product-updates/19) and will be back hosting a webinar at our regularly scheduled time in January. Wishing you all a peaceful and kind end to 2021.
