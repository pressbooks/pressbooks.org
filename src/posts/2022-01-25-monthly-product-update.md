Hi Open Source users! Excited to remind you all that we will be hosting our monthly Pressbooks product update on Thursday, January 27th from 2-3pm ET. The webinar will include a demonstration of recently released features and upcoming work at Pressbooks, followed by time for you to share news & updates about any general interest Pressbooks-related projects you’ve been working on. Here’s [a more detailed agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcvX0V-iDi6fJO_W8pHVOL_lec_9OTXujAfw6tFpZlQ/edit) which includes the Zoom link for the meeting. As always, the demo portion will be recorded and shared on our YouTube channel afterwards.
