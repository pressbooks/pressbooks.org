Hi Open Source users! I’ll be hosting a monthly product update webinar today (Thursday, February 24th) from 2-3pm ET. In addition to a walkthrough of features we’ve released recently, the meeting will include time for you to share news & updates about any general interest Pressbooks-related projects you’ve been working on. Here’s [a more detailed agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcvX0V-iDi6fJO_W8pHVOL_lec_9OTXujAfw6tFpZlQ/edit), which includes the meeting’s Zoom link. The product demo portion will be recorded and shared on YouTube afterwards.
