While Pressbooks is open source and free for you to use, it’s not free for us to create
and maintain. As a result, we ask our open source users, who depend on the long-term
sustainability of the software, to contribute to the project in various ways. Our
favourite kinds of support are:

- code contributions and testing
- open source user support
- financial contributions

If you are an institution using Pressbooks and would like to help sustain Pressbooks
financially at any level, please consider
[hosting Pressbooks with us](https://pressbooks.com/educational-institutions/) or
[contact us](mailto:sales@pressbooks.com) so that we can discuss how best to work
together.

## Want to get involved?

The Pressbooks Open Source community is made up of people and organizations who use
Pressbooks for all kinds of publishing.

## Monthly Product Update

We hold an open meeting at 2pm EST on the last Thursday of each month to discuss
developments and new and ongoing projects. To join us (please do!), keep an eye on the
[Development](https://pressbooks.community/c/development) channel in our forum for details
on how to join the call at the end of each month.

## Pressbooks Forum

[Our forum](https://pressbooks.community/) is a place for developers and Open Source users
to discuss forthcoming features, and for users to ask the community for help. If you use
Pressbooks, we invite you to help others who may be encountering issues.

## GitHub

You can always report bugs, open pull requests, and follow our
development [on GitHub](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/). We also maintain an
[ideas repository](https://github.com/pressbooks/ideas) where we welcome product
suggestions and feature improvements from any and all.
