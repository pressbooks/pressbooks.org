title: Support Pressbooks
layout: 'layouts/page.njk'
---

While Pressbooks is free & open source software, creating, improving, and maintaining this project takes time, effort, 
and money. As a result, we ask our open source users, who depend on the long-term sustainability of the software, to 
contribute to the project in various ways. Our favourite kinds of support are:

- financial contributions
- code contributions and testing
- support for open source users

If you are an institution using Pressbooks and would like to help sustain Pressbooks financially at any level, please 
consider [hosting Pressbooks with us](https://pressbooks.com/educational-institutions/) or 
[contacting us](mailto:sales@pressbooks.com) to discuss how best to work together.

# Want to get involved?

The Pressbooks Open Source community is made up of people and organizations who use Pressbooks for many kinds of 
publishing.

## Monthly Product Update

We hold an open meeting at 2pm EST on the last Thursday of each month to discuss recently releases and upcoming work. 
See our [running agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcvX0V-iDi6fJO_W8pHVOL_lec_9OTXujAfw6tFpZlQ/edit) for 
details on how to join those updates, or watch recordings of past meetings on our 
[YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM9fjHLyJsM&list=PLMFmJu3NJhet17A4FC_84OVDS8N18YyIo).

## Pressbooks Forum

[Our forum](https://pressbooks.community/) is a place for developers and Open Source users to discuss issues of interest
and ask others in the community for help. If you use Pressbooks, we invite you to help others in the community who may 
be encountering issues.

## GitHub

At Pressbooks we use the Scrum framework for software development. You can always report bugs, open pull requests, and 
follow our development [on GitHub](https://github.com/pressbooks/). We also maintain an 
[ideas repository](https://github.com/pressbooks/ideas) where we welcome product suggestions and feature improvements 
from any and all. Our product owner regularly reviews these suggestions and adds them to our product backlog.
